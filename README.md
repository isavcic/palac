## Overview

Palac came to be as an offshoot of Sofle. The current idea behind it is to create a straightforward split keyboard: no rotary encoders, no backlight, and to explore no stagger in the pinky column: with the pinky positioned slightly below the center of the home row key, in case of five rows one could reach the top and the bottom row with same ease.
